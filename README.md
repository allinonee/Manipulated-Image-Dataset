# Manipulated-Image-Dataset

- A dataset of manipulated images using 11 image editing tools.
- Manipulation performed through object removal and background removal function.
- Manipulated images generated by considering the post-processing steps and storage methods provided by each editing tool, based on 11 original images (refer to the CSV).
- Total of 968 images.

The utilization and detailed information of the dataset can be found in the preprinted paper [here](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2308.04723). This dataset can contribute to studies focusing on analyzing graphical differences in post-processing stages of applications, as well as detecting manipulated regions.
